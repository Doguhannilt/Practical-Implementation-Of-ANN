<h1>What Does Artificial Neural Network Mean?</h1>
<p>An artificial neuron network (neural network) is a computational model that mimics the way nerve cells work in the human brain.</p>

<p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) use learning algorithms that can independently make adjustments – or learn, in a sense – as they receive new input. This makes them a very effective tool for non-linear statistical data modeling.</p>

<p>Deep learning ANNs play an important role in machine learning (ML) and support the broader field of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.</p>
